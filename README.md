syncthing-ubuntu-indicator
==========================

A [Syncthing] status menu for Ubuntu,
using Syncthings event interface to display informations about what's going on.

This is a fork from Stuart Langridges [syncthing-ubuntu-indicator].

The project is in an early stage and contributions are welcome.

dependencies
==========================

* python2 AppIndicator3
* python2 gtk 
* python-dateutil (python2 version)
* python-tz (python2 version)



(I'm running Arch Linux so somebody maybe can fill the dependencies for other distributions, if there are some?)

installation
==========================
just run via terminal ./syncthing-ubuntu-indicator.sh

When you are using GNOME3 you can move the icon with the [gnome-shell-extension-appindicator] in the upper notification bar.
